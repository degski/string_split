# string_split
A string splitter allowing strings as delimiters, written in C++17.

Pass in a STL-string, followed by the delimiters. The order of the passed in delimiters is important as the delimiters are applied left to right (recursively, bf).

It's header only, with no other dependencies than the STL.
